MVA - thyroid0387
==================

We possibly want to combine PCA and MCA in our project. We were told to do the following:
1- normalize/arrange the principal components from each analysis in order to have 100% variance explained in total
2- combine them and select the sginificant components
3- project categorical vars to PCA significant principal components and project continouous vars to MCA singificant principal components


structure
	ok- sharelatex
	ok- bitbucket
	ok- main.R with other files for each subtask


preprocessing

	decision over TBG imputation
		ok-decide about TBG, T3 and others that have a lot of missing values
		if TSH abnormal T3,
		ok- causality or dependence between tests
		ok- normal range 10-24 vs mean 29 vs people w. condition range 30 - ..200
		ok->options
			remove
			mice on all
			healty to mean of healty -> 22.9 + mice on others
		ok-> we choose mice
			we do PCA and see the difference in variance explained
			TBG is well represented in the first fact. plane and 
			TBG is highly correlated with second component
			-> we decide to keep it
				
		-> conclude on mice
			different options, their result, why we conclude about mice

	feature selection?
	feature extraction (target 20 classes to 7 classes)


visualization
	PCA?
	rotation

clustering
	Hierarchical + Kmeans

interpreation
	profiling? -> catdes



prediction model
	separate test and training?
	random forest
	validation protocol OOB

2. The pre-process of data


3. The protocol of validation
	-> about cv and oob for trees
	-> macro F-measure for multiclass

4. The visualisation performed
	PCA + rotation
