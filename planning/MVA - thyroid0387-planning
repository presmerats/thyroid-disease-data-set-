MVA - thyroid0387
==================

We possibly want to combine PCA and MCA in our project. We were told to do the following:
1- normalize/arrange the principal components from each analysis in order to have 100% variance explained in total
2- combine them and select the sginificant components
3- project categorical vars to PCA significant principal components and project continouous vars to MCA singificant principal components


preprocessing

	decision over TBG imputation
		-decide about TBG, T3 and others that have a lot of missing values
		if TSH abnormal T3,

	transf
		- 7 classe only
		- 2 classe only


	- sharelatex
	- bitbucket
	- main.R with other files for each subtask

	categorical and continuous

	summary
	errors
	missing values -> mice
	outliers



	feature selection?
	feature extraction (target 20 classes to 7 classes)

visualization
	PCA?
	rotation

clustering
	Hierarchical + Kmeans

interpreation
	profiling? -> catdes



prediction model
	separate test and training?
	random forest
	validation protocol OOB


Report:

1. A description of the problem and available data

2. The pre-process of data


3. The protocol of validation
	-> about cv and oob for trees

4. The visualisation performed
	PCA + rotation	

5. The interpretation of the latent concepts.
	rotation


6. The clustering performed
7. The interpretation of the found clusters.
8. Discussion about the differences of the test sample respect to the
training one.
9. The prediction model with its best parameterization and its
generalization error
10.Scientific and personal conclusions
