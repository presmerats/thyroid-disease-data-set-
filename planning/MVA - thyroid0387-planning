MVA - thyroid0387
==================

We possibly want to combine PCA and MCA in our project. We were told to do the following:
1- normalize/arrange the principal components from each analysis in order to have 100% variance explained in total
2- combine them and select the sginificant components
3- project categorical vars to PCA significant principal components and project continouous vars to MCA singificant principal components


preprocessing

	ok-decision over TBG imputation
		-decide about TBG, T3 and others that have a lot of missing values
		if TSH abnormal T3,


	ok- sharelatex
	ok- bitbucket
	ok- main.R with other files for each subtask

	ok- categorical and continuous
			-> all continuous

	ok-summary
	ok-errors
	ok-missing values -> mice
	ok-outliers


	ok-feature selection
->	- verify the contribution with PCA?
	
->	feature extraction (target 20 classes to 7 classes)
		- 7 classe only
		- 4 classes Hyper, Hypo, other, normal
		- 2 classe only





		visualization
			PCA?
				with all vars
				+ feature selection
				+ comparison with RF feature selection
->			rotation

->		clustering
			Hierarchical + Kmeans

		interpreation
			profiling? -> catdes



		prediction model
			separate test and training?
			random forest
			validation protocol OOB


Report:

obs:
	we expect rf to be better if a lot of vars are explinatory
	CART to be better if only a small subset of vars are explanatory

1. A description of the problem and available data

2. The pre-process of data


3. The protocol of validation
	-> about cv and oob for trees

4. The visualisation performed
	PCA + rotation	

5. The interpretation of the latent concepts.
	rotation


6. The clustering performed
7. The interpretation of the found clusters.
8. Discussion about the differences of the test sample respect to the
training one.
